# Predicting Stock Prices using Neural Networks

When deciding a topic for this case study, we were immediately drawn to the Kaggle stock price dataset. Yes, this was definitely our first choice for a project.

## Overview

After our pivot at around 11am, our main priority was to build a working model. Due to our self imposed time constraints, we decided to use tips from other Kaggle users to clean our dataset as quick as possible so we could focus on building the model and analyzing our results.

## Model

For our predictions, we used LSTM to build a recurrent neural network. Instead of using all 30 companies in the dataset, we built our model using smaller samples of the companies.

## Process

We initially used Google's stock to build and tune our model.

Next, we focused on technology stocks to see how grouping companies from similar industries impacted our predictions.
